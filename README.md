The challenge pits two players against each other on a rectangular map. They each get 1 base with 3 hit points (on opposed corners) and 3 heroes who can move, attack and use spells. The twist is that the heroes can only attack monsters (who regularly and symmetrically spawn from the edge of the map), not other heroes nor enemy base. Doing so generates mana, which is used to cast spells. Monsters within a certain radius of a playerâ€™s base will be attracted to it, and if they are not killed before reaching it they do 1 hit point of damage. A player whose base drops to 0 hit points obviously loses the game.

Players play through a program they write beforehand, with no input nor command during the game. The programming language was free of choice. The program received data each turn describing the state of the battlefield and must output 3 lines, each one describing an heroâ€™s action for the turn.

The challenge worked by leagues (namely Wood 2, Wood 1, Bronze, Silver, Gold and Legend) where you had to defeat a NPC Boss and a fixed amount of players to rank up. On Legends there was no Boss and players where ranked with an ELO-like system.
